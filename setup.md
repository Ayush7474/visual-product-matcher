# Setup Instructions

Below are the steps I followed to setup the local dev environment:

**Python side**
- Created virtual environment (venv)  
- Activated it  
- Upgraded pip  
- Installed required packages (will list in later commit)  

**Node / Frontend side**
- Initialized project with `npm init`  
- Installed any other dependencies (to be added later)  

**Other tools**
- yet to add
